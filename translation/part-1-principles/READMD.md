# Principles
## 1 The Transaction

> A school in Connecticut once held "a day devoted to the arts," and I was asked if I would come and talk about writing as a vocation. When I arrived I found that a second speaker had been invited-Dr. Brock(as I'll call him), a surgeon who had recently begun to write and had sold some stories to magazines. He was going to talk about writing as an avocation. That made us a pannel, and we sat down to face a crowd of students and teachers and parents, all eager to learn the secrets of our glamorous work.

康涅狄格州的一所学校曾经举办了“将一天奉献给艺术”的活动，我被邀请来做关于写作作为一种职业的演讲。当我到达时，我发现第二位被受邀的演讲人是布洛克博士（我将这样称呼他），他是一名外科医生，最近开始写作且出售了一些故事给杂志。他将要谈论写作作为一种业务爱好。这样让我们组成了一个小组，我们坐下来面对着一大群渴望能学习了解我们独特工作秘密的学生，教师和父母。

> Dr. Brock was dressed in a bright red jacket, looking vaguely bohemian, as authors are supposed to look, and the first question went to him. What was it like to be a writer?

- 

</details>

布洛克博士身穿明亮的红色夹克，看起来略带波西米亚风格，就像人们认为作家就应该是这个样子，他被问到的第一个问题是：当作家感觉如何？

> He said it was tremendous fun. Coming home from an arduous day at the hosptial, he would go straight to his yellow pad and write his tensions away. The words just flowed. It was easy. I then said that writing wasn't easy, and wasn't fun. It was hard and lonely, and the words seldom just flowed.

  - “This is a tremendous opportunity for us. ”（这对我们来说是一个极好的机会。）
- “arduous”：形容词，意为“艰苦的；艰难的；费力的”。

- “tension”：名词，常见释义为“紧张；张力；拉力”。
  - “There is a lot of tension in the room. ”（房间里气氛很紧张。）

</details>

他说这非常有趣。在医院度过辛苦的一天回到家后，他会径直走向他的黄色便笺簿，通过写作来消除紧张情绪。文思泉涌。这很简单。然后我说写作并不简单也不有趣。写作是艰难且孤独的，而且很少能文思泉涌。

> Next Dr. Brock was asked if it was important to rewrite. Absolutely not, he said. "Let it all hang out," he told us, and whatever form the sentences take will reflect the writer at his most natural. I then said that rewriting is the essence of writing. I pointed out that professional writers rewrite their sentences over and over and then rewrite what they have rewriten.
<details>
<summary>生词</summary>

- the essence of “......的本质；......的精髓”
  - “The essence of the problem lies in the lack of communication. ”（问题的本质在于缺乏沟通。）

</details>
接下来，布洛克博士被问到重写是否重要。绝对不是，“顺其自然”，他告诉我们，无论句子采取何种形式都将反映出作者最自然的状态。我随后说道，重写是写作的精髓。我指出职业作家重写他们的句子一遍又一遍，然后重写他们已经重写过的内容。

> "What do you do on days when it isn't going well?" Dr. Brock was asked. He said he just stopped writing and put the work aside for a day when it would go better. I then said that the professional writer must establish a daily schedule and stick to it. I said that writing is a craft, not an art, and that the man who runs away from his craft because he lacks inspiration is fooling himself. He is also going broke.

“你在写作不顺利的时候是怎么做的呢？”，布洛克博士被问到。他说只是停止写作然后将工作搁置到一边直到事情有所改善。然后我说，一个职业的作家必须建立日常写作计划并坚持到底。我说写作是一件手艺，而不是一门艺术，一个人如果因为缺乏灵感而躲避他的手艺是自欺欺人。他也会走向破产。
 
>"What if you're feeling depressed or unhappy?" a student asked. "Won't that affect your writing?"

当你感到绝望或不高兴的时候会怎么样？一个学生问到，这样是否会影响到你的写作？

> Probably it will, Dr. Brock replied. Go fishing. Take a walk. Probably it won't, I said. If your job is to write every day, you learn to do it like any other job.

可能会。布洛克博士回答到。钓鱼、散步。我说大概率是不会的，如果你的工作是每天都写作，那么你就需要像做其他工作一样，学会在这种环境中写作。

> A student asked if we found it useful to circulate in the literary world. Dr. Brock said he was greatly enjoying his new life as a man of letters, and he told several stories of being taken to lunch by his publisher and his agent at Manhattan restaurants where writers and editors gather. I said that professional writers are solitary drudges who seldom see other writers.

  - “He was regarded as a prominent man of letters. ”（他被视为一位杰出的文人。）
- “drudge”：名词，意思是“苦工；做苦工的人”。-
  - “He has been a drudge in the factory for years. ”（他在工厂里做苦工多年了。）

</details>


一个学生问我们发现在文学世界中流转是否是有用的。布洛克博士说他很享受作为文人的新生活，他讲诉了几个他被出版商和经纪人带去曼哈顿作家和编辑常去的餐厅吃午餐的故事。我说职业的作家都是孤独的苦工，很少见到其他作家。

> "Do you put symbolism in your writing?" a student asked me.

“你的作品有象征意义吗？”一个学生问到。

> "Not if I can help it," I replied. I have an unbroken record of missing the deeper meaning in any story, play or movie, and as for dance and mine, I have never had any idea of what is being conveyed.

“如果可能的话，我不会那样做，”我回答说，我在任何故事，戏剧或电影中从未理解过深层含义，至于舞蹈和哑剧，我从未明白他们想表达的是什么。

> "I love symbols!" Dr. Brock exclaimed, and he described with gusto the joys of weaving them through his work.

“我喜欢象征！”布洛克博士惊呼道，他兴致勃勃地描绘了将他们融入到工作中的乐趣。

  - “She weaves baskets from reeds. ”（她用芦苇编篮子。）

</details>

> So the morning went, and it was a revelation to all of us. At the end Dr. Brock told me he was enormously interested in my answers--it had never occurred to him that writing could be hard. I told him I was just as interested in his answers--it had never occurred to me that writing could be easy. Maybe I should take up surgery on the side.

所以，整个早晨就这样过去了，这对我们所有人来说都是一个启示。最后布洛克博士告诉我他对我的答案很感兴趣--他从未想过写作可能会很难。我告诉他我对他的回答同样很感兴趣--我从未想过写作可以这么简单。或许我应该在业余时间尝试学习做手术。

> As for the students, anyone might think we left them bewildered. But in fact we gave them a broader glimpse of the writing process than if only one of us had talked. For there isn't any "right" way to do such personal work. There are all kinds of writers and all kinds of methods, and any method that helps you to say what you want to say is the right method for you. Some people write by day, others by night. Some people need silence, others turn on the radio. Some write by hand, some by word processor, some by talking into a tape recorder. Some people write their first draft in one long burst and then revise; others can't write the second paragraph until they have fiddled endlessly with the first.

</details>


至于学生们，任何人可能都会认为我们让他们感到困惑。但事实上，我们让他们对写作过程有了更广泛的了解，这比只有我们其中一人发言的效果要好。因为对于这种个人化的工作并没有“正确”的方式。有各种各样的作家和方法，任何能帮助你说你想说的方法对你来说都是好的方法。有些人白天写作，有些人晚上写作。有些人需要安静，有些人则打开收音机。有些人手写，有些人用文字处理器，有些人对着录音机口述。有些人一口气写完初稿然后修改；有些人不反复修改第一段就写不出第二段。

> But all of them are vulnerable and all of them are tense. They are driven by a compulsion to put some part of themselves on paper, and yet they don't just write what comes naturally. They sit down to commit an act of literature, and the self who emerges on paper is far stiffer than the person who sat down to write. The problem is to find the real man or woman behind the tension.

但是他们都是脆弱且紧张的。他们迫不及待把自己的某些部分写在纸上，但他们并不是写下自然而然的东西。他们坐下来进行文学行为，而出现在纸上的自我比坐下来的写作的人要僵硬的多。问题是找到隐藏在紧张背后的真实男人或女人。

> Ultimately the product that any writer has to sell is not the subject being written about, but who he or she is. I often find myself reading with interest about a topic I never thought would interest me—some scientific quest, perhaps. What holds me is the enthusiasm of the writer for his field. How was he drawn into it? What emotional baggage did he bring along? How did it change his life? It's not necessary to want to spend a year alone at Walden Pond to become involved with a writer who did.

最后作家需要售卖的商品并不是作品本身，而是他或她自己。我经常发现自己读我从未想过会让我感到有趣的有趣的话题--或许是一些科学探索。吸引我的是作家对其领域的热情。他是如何被吸引进去的？他带来了什么样的情感包袱？怎么样改变了他的生活？没有必要孤独地在瓦尔登湖生活了一年之后才能与这样一位作家交往。

> This is the personal transaction that's at the heart of good nonfiction writing. Out of it come two of the most important qualities that this book will go in search of: humanity and warmth. Good writing has an aliveness that keeps the reader reading from one paragraph to the next, and it's not a question of gimmicks to "personalize" the author. It's a question of using the English language in a way that will achieve the greatest clarity and strength.

<details>
<summary>生词</summary>

- “gimmick”：名词，意为“噱头；花招；诡计”。
  - “The new product was just a marketing gimmick. ”（这个新产品只是个营销噱头。）

</details>

这是优秀的非小说写作的核心所在的个人交流。由此产生了本书将要寻找的两个重要的品质：人性和温情。好的写作有一种活力可以让读者从一段读到下一段，这不是个性化作者噱头的问题。问题在于如何以最清晰最有力的方式使用英语。

> Can such principles be taught? Maybe not. But most of them can be learned.
这样的原则能被教授吗？也许不能。但其中大多数是可以学习的。

## 2 Simplicity
> Clutter is the disease of American writing. We are a society strangling in unnecessary words, circular constructions, pompous frills and meaningless jargon.

<details>

</details>

杂乱无章是美国写作的弊病。我们是一个被不必要的词汇、循环结构、浮夸的修饰和毫无意义的行话所窒息的社会。

> Who can understand the clotted language of everyday American commerce: the memo, the corporation report, the business letter, the notice from the bank explaining its latest "simplified" statement? What member of an insurance or medical plan can decipher the brochure explaining his costs and benefits? What father or mother can put together a child's toy from the instructions on the box? Our national tendency is to inflate and thereby sound important. The airline pilot who announces that he is presently anticipating experiencing considerable precipitation wouldn't think of saying it may rain. The sentence is too simple—there must be something wrong with it.

</details>

谁能理解日常美国商业中那些晦涩难懂的语言：备忘录、公司报告、商业信函、银行解释其最新“简化”对账单的通知？哪个保险或医疗计划的成员能解读解释其成本和福利的小册子？哪位父亲或母亲能根据盒子上的说明组装孩子的玩具？我们国家的趋势是膨胀化，从而听起来很重要。宣布他目前预期会经历相当多降水的航空公司飞行员不会考虑说可能会下雨。这个句子太简单了——一定有什么问题。

> But the secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb, every passive con-struction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what— these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence. And they usually occur in proportion to education and rank.

<details>

- **strip**: 动词，这里意为"剥去；剥离"。
  - "The old building was stripped of its paint."（这座旧建筑的油漆被剥掉了。）
  - "To write well, you must strip your sentences to their essentials."（要写得好，你必须把句子剥离到其基本要素。）

- **cleanest components**: 这里指的是"最纯净的组成部分"，比喻为句子中最基本的元素。
  - "The design is based on the cleanest components of modern architecture."（这个设计基于现代建筑中最纯净的组成部分。）

- **rank**: 名词，这里意为"级别；等级"。

</details>

但是好的写作的秘诀在于将每个句子剥离到其最简洁的成分。每一个有功能的词，每一个可以用简短词代替的长词，每一个与动词含义相同的副词，每一个让读者不确定谁在做什么的被动结构--这些都是削弱句子力量的千百种杂质。而且他们通常与教育和地位成正比。

> During the 1960s the president of my university wrote a letter to mollify the alumni after a spell of campus unrest. "You are probably aware," he began, "that we have been experiencing very considerable potentially explosive expressions of dissatisfaction on issues only partially related." He meant that the students had been hassling them about different things. I was far more upset by the president s English than by the students' potentially explosive expressions of dissatisfaction. I would have preferred the presidential approach taken by Franklin D. Roosevelt when he tried to convert into English his own governments memos, such as this blackout order of 1942:

在20世纪60年代，我的大学校长写了一封信，以安抚校友们在校园动荡之后的情绪。“你可能已经意识到，”他开始写道，“我们一直在经历一些非常重大的、潜在的爆炸性的不满情绪的表达，这些问题只有部分是相关的。”他的意思是学生们一直在为不同的事情而困扰他们。我对校长的英语比对学生们潜在的爆炸性不满情绪更感到不安。我更希望校长能采取富兰克林·D·罗斯福总统的方式，当他试图将他自己的政府备忘录翻译成英语时，比如1942年的这个宵禁令：

我走进森林，因为我希望有意识地生活，直面生活的基本事实，并看看我能否从中学到什么，而不是当我临终时，发现我并没有真正活过。



> How can the rest of us achieve such enviable freedom from clutter? The answer is to clear our heads of clutter. Clear thinking becomes clear writing; one can't exist without the other. It's impossible for a muddy thinker to write good English. He may get away with it for a paragraph or two, but soon the reader will be lost, and there's no sin so grave, for the reader will not easily be lured back.

  - "The room was filled with clutter."（房间里堆满了杂物。）
  - "We need to declutter our lives to improve focus."（我们需要清理生活中的杂乱无章，以提高专注力。）

- **sin** 在这里指严重的错误或过失
  - "Lying is considered a sin in many cultures."（在许多文化中，撒谎被视为一种严重的错误。）

我们其他人如何能够实现这种令人羡慕的无杂乱自由呢？答案是要清除我们头脑中的杂乱。清晰的思考会带来清晰的写作；二者缺一不可。一个思维混乱的人不可能写出好的英语。他可能在一两段中蒙混过关，但很快读者就会迷失，没有比这更严重的罪过了，因为读者将不会轻易被吸引回来。


> Who is this elusive creature, the reader? The reader is some- one with an attention span of about 30 seconds—a person assailed by many forces competing for attention. At one time those forces were relatively few: newspapers, magazines, radio, spouse, chil- dren, pets. Today they also include a "home entertainment center" (television, VCR, tapes, CDs), e-mail, the Internet, the cellular phone, the fax machine, a fitness program, a pool, a lawn, and that most potent of competitors, sleep. The man or woman snoozing in a chair with a magazine or a book is a person who was being given too much unnecessary trouble by the writer.

这位难以捉摸的生物，读者，是谁呢？读者是一个大约有30秒注意力持续时间的人——一个被许多争夺注意力的力量困扰的人。曾经，这些力量相对较少：报纸、杂志、广播、配偶、孩子、宠物。今天，它们还包括“家庭娱乐中心”（电视、录像机、磁带、光盘）、电子邮件、互联网、手机、传真机、健身计划、游泳池、草坪，以及最有力的竞争对手，睡眠。在椅子上打盹，手里拿着杂志或书籍的人，是被作者给予太多不必要的麻烦的人。


> It won't do to say that the reader is too dumb or too lazy to keep pace with the train of thought. If the reader is lost, it's usually because the writer hasn't been careful enough. That carelessness can take any number of forms. Perhaps a sentence is so excessively cluttered that the reader, hacking through the verbiage, simply doesn't know what it means. Perhaps a sentence has been so shoddily constructed that the reader could read it in several ways. Perhaps the writer has switched pronouns in mid- sentence, or has switched tenses, so the reader loses track of who is talking or when the action took place. Perhaps Sentence B is not a logical sequel to Sentence A; the writer, in whose head the connection is clear, hasn't bothered to provide the missing link. Perhaps the writer has used a word incorrectly by not tak- ing the trouble to look it up. He or she may think "sanguine" and "sanguinary" mean the same thing, but the difference is a bloody big one. The reader can only infer (speaking of big dif- ferences) what the writer is trying to imply.

说读者太笨或太懒，跟不上思路是不行的。如果读者迷失了，通常是因为作者没有足够小心。这种粗心可以采取多种形式。也许一个句子过于杂乱，读者在费力理解冗长的措辞时，根本不知道它的意思。也许一个句子构造得如此草率，读者可以以几种方式阅读它。也许作者在句子中途换了代词，或者换了时态，以至于读者弄不清楚谁在说话或行动发生在何时。也许B句不是A句的逻辑续集；作者脑海中的联系很清楚，却没有费心提供缺失的联系。也许作者没有费心去查字典，错误地使用了单词。他或她可能认为"sanguine"和"sanguinary"意思相同，但差别是很大的。读者只能推断（说到大差别）作者试图暗示的内容。


> Two pages of the final manuscript of this chapter from the First Edition ofOn Writing Well. Although they look like a first draft, they had already been rewritten and retyped—like almost every other page— four or five times. With each rewrite I try to make what I have written tighter, stronger and more precise, eliminating every element that's not doing useful work. Then I go over it once more, reading it aloud, and am always amazed at how much clutter can still be cut. (In later edi- tions I eliminated the sexist pronoun "he" denoting "the writer" and "the reader.")

这是《写作之道》第一版最后一章手稿的两页。尽管它们看起来像是初稿，但它们已经像其他几乎所有页面一样，被重写和重新打印了四到五次。每次重写，我尝试使我所写的内容更紧凑、更强有力、更精确，消除每一个没有在做有用工作的成分。然后我再次审阅它，大声朗读，总是惊讶于仍然可以削减多少杂乱。（在后来的版本中，我消除了表示“作家”和“读者”的性别歧视代词“他”。）


> Faced with such obstacles, readers are at first tenacious. They blame themselves—they obviously missed something, and they go back over the mystifying sentence, or over the whole paragraph, piecing it out like an ancient rune, making guesses and moving on. But they won't do that for long. The writer is making them work too hard, and they will look for one who is better at the craft.

面对这样的障碍，读者最初是坚韧不拔的。他们责备自己——他们显然错过了一些东西，于是他们回头去读那些令人迷惑的句子，或者整个段落，像解读古代符文一样拼凑它，做出猜测然后继续。但他们不会长时间这样做。作者让他们工作得太辛苦了，他们会寻找一个在技艺上更擅长的人。


> Writers must therefore constantly ask: what am I trying to say? Surprisingly often they don't know. Then they must look at what they have written and ask: have I said it? Is it clear to someone encountering the subject for the first time? If it's not, some fuzz has worked its way into the machinery. The clear writer is someone clearheaded enough to see this stuff for what it is: fuzz.

因此，作家必须不断地问：我想说什么？ 令人惊讶的是，他们常常不知道。 然后他们必须看看自己写的内容并问：我说过吗？ 对于第一次接触这个主题的人来说是否清楚？ 如果不是，则说明机器中已经出现了一些毛病。 清晰的作家是那些头脑清醒的人，能够看到这些东西的本质：模糊。

> I don't mean that some people are born clearheaded and are therefore natural writers, whereas others are naturally fuzzy and will never write well. Thinking clearly is a conscious act that writers must force on themselves, as if they were working on any other project that requires logic: making a shopping list or doing an algebra problem. Good writing doesn't come naturally, though most people seem to think it does. Professional writers are constantly bearded by people who say they'd like to "try a little writing sometime"—meaning when they retire from their real profession, like insurance or real estate, which is hard. Or they say,"I could write a book about that." I doubt it.

我并不是说有些人天生头脑清醒，因此是天生的作家，而另一些人则天生模糊，永远写不出好作品。 清晰思考是作家必须强迫自己的一种有意识的行为，就像他们正在从事任何其他需要逻辑的项目一样：列出购物清单或做代数问题。 好的写作并不是自然而然的，尽管大多数人似乎认为它是自然而然的。 专业作家经常被那些说他们想“找个时间尝试一点写作”的人留着胡子——意思是当他们从保险或房地产等真正的职业退休时，这很难。 或者他们说，“我可以写一本关于这个的书。” 我对此表示怀疑。
