## 2 Simplicity
> Clutter is the disease of American writing. We are a society strangling in unnecessary words, circular constructions, pompous frills and meaningless jargon.

美国写作的疾病是杂乱。我们的社会被不必要的词，循环结构，浮华的修饰和无意义的行话扼杀的社会。

> Who can understand the clotted language of everyday American commerce: the memo, the corporation report, the business letter, the notice from the bank explaining its latest "simplified" statement? What member of an insurance or medical plan can decipher the brochure explaining his costs and benefits? What father or mother can put together a child's toy from the instructions on the box? Our national tendency is to inflate and thereby sound important. The airline pilot who announces that he is presently anticipating experiencing considerable precipitation wouldn't think of saying it may rain. The sentence is too simple—there must be something wrong with it.                                            

谁能理解日常美国商业中混乱的语言：备忘录、公司报告、商业信函、银行解释其最新“简化”账单的通知？哪位保险或医疗计划的成员能够解读解释其成本和福利的小册子？哪位父亲或母亲能够根据盒子上的说明组装孩子的玩具？我们的国家倾向是膨胀并因此听起来很重要。那个宣布他目前预计会经历相当大的降水的飞行员，不会想到说可能会下雨。这个句子太简单了——一定有什么问题。

> But the secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb, every passive con-struction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what— these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence. And they usually occur in proportion to education and rank.

但是好的写作的秘诀在于将每个句子剥离到其最纯净的成分。每一个有功能的词，每一个可以用简短词代替的长词，每一个与动词含义相同的副词，每一个让读者不确定谁在做什么的被动结构--这些都是削弱句子力量的千百种杂质。而且他们通常与教育和地位成正比。

> During the 1960s the president of my university wrote a letter to mollify the alumni after a spell of campus unrest. "You are probably aware," he began, "that we have been experiencing very considerable potentially explosive expressions of dissatisfaction on issues only partially related." He meant that the students had been hassling them about different things. I was far more upset by the president s English than by the students' potentially explosive expressions of dissatisfaction. I would have preferred the presidential approach taken by Franklin D. Roosevelt when he tried to convert into English his own governments memos, such as this blackout order of 1942:

在20世纪60年代，我们大学校长写了一封信，目的是在校园骚乱之后安抚校友。他这样开始的：“你可能已经意识到，我们一致经历非常重大的潜在的爆炸性的不满表达，这些问题只是部分相关。”，他的意思是学生们一直在就不同的事情给他们制造麻烦。我对校长的英语比对学生们潜在的爆炸性不满表达更感到不安。我更希望校长采取富兰克林·D·罗斯福总统的方式，当他试图将他自己的政府备忘录翻译成英语时，比如1942年的这个宵禁令：

> Such preparations shall be made as will completely obscure all Federal buildings and non-Federal buildings occupied by the Federal government during an air raid for any period of time from visibility by reason of internal or external illumination.

应采取如下措施，在空袭期间，将联邦政府占据的所有的联邦大楼和非联邦大楼在任何时间内完全遮蔽，以避免因内部或外部照明而从视线中可见。

> "Tell them," Roosevelt said, "that in buildings where they have to keep the work going to put something across the windows."

"告诉他们，"罗斯福说，"在那些必须继续工作的地方，要在窗户上放些东西。"

> Simplify, simplify. Thoreau said it, as we are so often reminded, and no American writer more consistently practiced what he preached. Open Walden to any page and you will find a man saying in a plain and orderly way what is on his mind:

简化，简化。 正如我们经常被提醒的那样，梭罗说过这句话，没有哪个美国作家比他更一贯地实践他所宣扬的。 打开《瓦尔登湖》任意一页，你都会发现一个人平淡而有条理地说出自己的想法：

> I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.

我之所以走进树林，是因为我希望认真地生活，只面对生活的基本事实，看看我是否能学到它所教的东西，而不是当我临终时，发现我并没有活过。

> How can the rest of us achieve such enviable freedom from clutter? The answer is to clear our heads of clutter. Clear thinking becomes clear writing; one can't exist without the other. It's impossible for a muddy thinker to write good English. He may get away with it for a paragraph or two, but soon the reader will be lost, and there's no sin so grave, for the reader will not easily be lured back.

我们其他人怎样才能摆脱混乱，获得如此令人羡慕的自由呢？ 答案是清除我们头脑中的混乱。 清晰的思维变成清晰的写作； 两者缺一不可。 一个思想泥泞的人是不可能写出好的英语的。 他可能会在一两段中侥幸逃脱，但很快读者就会迷失，没有什么罪孽如此严重，因为读者不会轻易被引诱回来。

> Who is this elusive creature, the reader? The reader is some- one with an attention span of about 30 seconds—a person assailed by many forces competing for attention. At one time those forces were relatively few: newspapers, magazines, radio, spouse, chil- dren, pets. Today they also include a "home entertainment center" (television, VCR, tapes, CDs), e-mail, the Internet, the cellular phone, the fax machine, a fitness program, a pool, a lawn, and that most potent of competitors, sleep. The man or woman snoozing in a chair with a magazine or a book is a person who was being given too much unnecessary trouble by the writer.

读者这个难以捉摸的生物是谁？ 读者是一个注意力持续时间约为 30 秒的人——一个受到多种争夺注意力的力量攻击的人。 曾经，这些力量相对较少：报纸、杂志、广播、配偶、孩子、宠物。 今天，它们还包括“家庭娱乐中心”（电视、录像机、磁带、CD）、电子邮件、互联网、移动电话、传真机、健身计划、游泳池、草坪，以及最强大的功能。 竞争对手，睡觉吧。 拿着一本杂志或一本书坐在椅子上打盹的男人或女人是一个被作家给了太多不必要的麻烦的人。

> It won't do to say that the reader is too dumb or too lazy to keep pace with the train of thought. If the reader is lost, it's usually because the writer hasn't been careful enough. That carelessness can take any number of forms. Perhaps a sentence is so excessively cluttered that the reader, hacking through the verbiage, simply doesn't know what it means. Perhaps a sentence has been so shoddily constructed that the reader could read it in several ways. Perhaps the writer has switched pronouns in mid- sentence, or has switched tenses, so the reader loses track of who is talking or when the action took place. Perhaps Sentence B is not a logical sequel to Sentence A; the writer, in whose head the connection is clear, hasn't bothered to provide the missing link. Perhaps the writer has used a word incorrectly by not tak- ing the trouble to look it up. He or she may think "sanguine" and "sanguinary" mean the same thing, but the difference is a bloody big one. The reader can only infer (speaking of big dif- ferences) what the writer is trying to imply.

这并不是说读者太笨或太懒，跟不上思路。如果读者思想抛锚了，通常都是因为作者不够小心。这种粗心可以是很多种形式。也许一个句子过于混乱，以至于读者在翻阅其中的措辞时根本不知道它的意思。 也许一个句子的结构非常粗制滥造，以至于读者可以用多种方式来阅读它。 也许作者在句子中间改变了代词，或者改变了时态，因此读者不知道谁在说话或动作何时发生。 也许句子 B 不是句子 A 的逻辑续集； 作者的头脑中这种联系是很清楚的，所以没有费心去提供缺失的链接。 也许作者没有花功夫去查，错误地使用了某个词。 他或她可能认为“乐观”和“血腥”是同一件事，但区别却很大。 读者只能推断（谈到巨大的差异）作者试图暗示什么。

> Two pages of the final manuscript of this chapter from the First Edition ofOn Writing Well. Although they look like a first draft, they had already been rewritten and retyped—like almost every other page— four or five times. With each rewrite I try to make what I have written tighter, stronger and more precise, eliminating every element that's not doing useful work. Then I go over it once more, reading it aloud, and am always amazed at how much clutter can still be cut. (In later edi- tions I eliminated the sexist pronoun "he" denoting "the writer" and "the reader.")

《论写作》第一版的本章最后手稿的两页。 尽管它们看起来像初稿，但它们已经被重写和重新打印了四五次——就像几乎所有其他页面一样。 每次重写时，我都会尝试使我所写的内容更紧凑、更强、更精确，消除所有无用的元素。 然后我又重读了一遍，大声朗读，总是惊讶于还能减少多少杂乱。 （在后来的版本中，我删除了代表“作者”和“读者”的性别歧视代词“他”。）

> Faced with such obstacles, readers are at first tenacious. They blame themselves—they obviously missed something, and they go back over the mystifying sentence, or over the whole paragraph, piecing it out like an ancient rune, making guesses and moving on. But they won't do that for long. The writer is making them work too hard, and they will look for one who is better at the craft.

面对这样的障碍，读者首先是顽强的。 他们责怪自己——他们显然错过了一些东西，然后他们回顾了令人费解的句子，或者回顾了整个段落，像古老的符文一样拼凑出来，做出猜测并继续前进。 但他们不会这样做太久。 作者让他们工作得太辛苦了，他们会寻找一个更擅长手艺的人。

> Writers must therefore constantly ask: what am I trying to say? Surprisingly often they don't know. Then they must look at what they have written and ask: have I said it? Is it clear to someone encountering the subject for the first time? If it's not, some fuzz has worked its way into the machinery. The clear writer is someone clearheaded enough to see this stuff for what it is: fuzz.

因此，作家必须不断地问：我想说什么？ 令人惊讶的是，他们常常不知道。 然后他们必须看看自己写的内容并问：我说过吗？ 对于第一次接触这个主题的人来说是否清楚？ 如果不是，则说明机器中已经出现了一些毛病。 清晰的作家是那些头脑清醒的人，能够看到这些东西的本质：模糊。

> I don't mean that some people are born clearheaded and are therefore natural writers, whereas others are naturally fuzzy and will never write well. Thinking clearly is a conscious act that writers must force on themselves, as if they were working on any other project that requires logic: making a shopping list or doing an algebra problem. Good writing doesn't come naturally, though most people seem to think it does. Professional writers are constantly bearded by people who say they'd like to "try a little writing sometime"—meaning when they retire from their real profession, like insurance or real estate, which is hard. Or they say,"I could write a book about that." I doubt it.

我并不是说有些人天生头脑清醒，因此是天生的作家，而另一些人则天生模糊，永远写不出好作品。 清晰思考是作家必须强迫自己的一种有意识的行为，就像他们正在从事任何其他需要逻辑的项目一样：列出购物清单或做代数问题。 好的写作并不是自然而然的，尽管大多数人似乎认为它是自然而然的。 专业作家经常被那些说他们想“找个时间尝试一点写作”的人留着胡子——意思是当他们从保险或房地产等真正的职业退休时，这很难。 或者他们说，“我可以写一本关于这个的书。” 我对此表示怀疑。

> Writing is hard work. A clear sentence is no accident. Very few sentences come out right the first time, or even the third time. Remember this in moments of despair. If you find that writing is hard, it's because it is hard.

写作是一项艰苦的工作。 清晰的句子绝非偶然。 很少有句子第一次甚至第三次就能说对。 在绝望的时刻记住这一点。 如果你发现写作很难，那是因为它很难。
